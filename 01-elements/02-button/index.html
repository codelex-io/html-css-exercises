  This is a figma design.
  To see how to access styles that were used for these buttons check out figma-tutorial.gif in this folder.
  Some things you cannot see in figma, but in css you should add cursor for all buttons and set outline:0 for active buttons,
  this removes the ugly outline, which all buttons have by default.
  Should also note, that buttons at default state have a border, which also should be removed.
