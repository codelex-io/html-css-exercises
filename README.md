# HTML/CSS exercises

## Instructions
Each sub-folder of `01-elements`, `02-components` and `03-pages` contains 3+ files: `index.html`, `styles.css` and image/gif files.

Your task is to follow instructions in each index.html file and create the correct html elements to match what is shown in the corresponding image/gif or figma design (links can be found in some index.html files). 

To match the styles, add class attributes to html elements, and modify each styles.css file.

Some css files will also have instructions.
